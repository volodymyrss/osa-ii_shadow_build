DESCRIPTION

   This program prepares IBIS/ISGRI data for scientific analysis. 
   Its main function is to split the data into energy bins and 
   time bins. 

   Be carefull, we select events with Corrected Rise Time given by 
   the parameters isgri_min_rise and isgri_max_rise. By default, 
   input values are respectively 16 and 116 corresponding to raw 
   rise time selection 7-80.

   The conversion of Low Threshold expressed in step into Low threshold 
   in kev takes into account the drift of energy with the 
   parameter "protonDOL".

   Any number of energy bins and time bins may be stipulated. 
   
   However, the user should keep in mind that a resolution lower 
   than that of the IBIS instrument is incoherent and will not 
   produce meaningful results.
   
   The number of images and boundary energies (keV) for each image
   are read from parameter file.

   The efficiency is calculated in the following manner :

   At the start of the revolution, ie the earth orbit, the ISGRI pixel 
   status is reset to reflect the past configurations. This is achieved 
   through uploading a context.

   Then, for every Science Window, we must know whether ISGRI pixel have
   been set On or Off by NPHS system. This is achieved by reading 
   HouseKeeping3 data.

   We also have to determine Good Time Intervals from ISGRI, from the
   modules and also from the user requirements. This induces a selection
   on events and a factor of efficiency:

       Eff= WGTI, and for pixels desactivated:
       Eff= 0.

   The deadtime must be included in the efficiency since 
   it effectively lowers the exposure time. Thus the above efficiency 
   must be weighted by the fractional deadtime, WDT. Thus, for pixels
   activated during the orbit:

       Eff= WGTI*(1-WDT), and for pixels desactivated:
       Eff= 0.

   Besides this correction, the efficiency for the lower energy bins might 
   depend on the energy due to the pixel lower threshold energy operation 
   limit. Then if WLT is the required correction,

       Eff= WGTI*(1-WDT)*WLT, and for pixels desactivated:
       Eff= 0.

   Finally, we also apply two different techniques of Noisy Pixels Exclusion:
   one is time-based on events, the other is spectral-based. The purpose is to
   set efficiency to ZERO for noisy pixels.

   It is this value that is given in the shadowgram efficiency maps.
